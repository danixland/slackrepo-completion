# SlackRepo Bash Completion

Bash completion file for [Slackrepo](http://idlemoor.github.io/slackrepo/index.html)

## Getting Started

Just copy this file (as root) to /etc/bash_completion.d and then source it like this:
```
#> cp slackrepo.completion /etc/bash_completion.d/slackrepo

#> . /etc/bash_completion.d/slackrepo
```

### Prerequisites

You need to have [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) and of course [slackrepo](http://idlemoor.github.io/slackrepo/index.html)

### Installing

If you want bash completion to be sourced everytime you run a shell add this at the beginning of your .bashrc file:
```
# turns on bash autocompletion
if [ -f /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh ]; then
 . /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh
fi
```
